MUST

- Check if all the equal methods require instanceof. (Test this by doing a equal on two different types)
- Create more and better unit tests

- Use Camelcase for variables, not underscores!

- Try to get rid of all the null stuff, use a nullObject

- Check all the variable names!
- Move classes and packages to create a good structure

- Acknowledge also 2 as money instead of only 2.00? (make nicer)
