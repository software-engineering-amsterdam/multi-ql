- Use multiple generic types for the visitor interface, or multiple interfaces
- Throw errors instead of adding them to a list
- Traversable class has multiple accepts, change to a single one using a generic type
- Create GUI
- Create tests
- Add line numbers
- Don't use a list for errors, cause then everything will become a string
- Make some kind of fancy issue class
- Remove the public static SymbolTable before next week. Its bad!
- Check all the variable names!
- Rename AST less class to lesser, so it matches with greater
- Use Identifiers as keys in the symboltable not the whole question object
- Remove toString in traversable interface
- Create equal methods for AST model classes, so I dont have to compare strings anymore. Mehh
- Remove the tempvariable smell! Just pass it on?
- Really use accept in the QuestionVisitor to fetch the identfiers, otherwise you get 10 gets behind each other. 
	And it makes the visitor kinda lame.
- Fix singe line and multi line comments in grammar
