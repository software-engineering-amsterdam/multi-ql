MUST

- Check if all the equal methods require instanceof. (Test this by doing a equal on two different types)
- Create more and better unit tests

- Use Camelcase for variables, not underscores!

- Try to get rid of all the null stuff, use a nullObject

- Remove the "getDefaultValue" thingy from the AST types? Seems a bit weird. Think about it!
- Check all the variable names!
- Move classes and packages to create a good structure

SHOULD
- Memento for resetting the stateTable?
- Acknowledge also 2 as money instead of only 2.00? (make nicer)
- Factory for the GUI
