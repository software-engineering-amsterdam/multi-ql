MUST
- Remove the tempvariable smell! Just pass it on?
- Check all the variable names!
- Create more tests
- Better error handling
- Seperate the symbol table so one is for the typechecker and the other one is for the evaluator (states).
- Move classes and packages to create a good structure
- Do a Fixpoint loop for evaluating.  

SHOULD
- Fix line numbers in error messages
- Acknowledge also 2 as money instead of only 2.00?
- Dependency based evaluating may be very cool, so the fixpoint loop is not needed anymore.
- Memento for resetting the stateTable?
- Factory for the GUI

COULD
- QLS
