MUST

- Check if all the equal methods require instanceof. (Test this by doing a equal on two different types)
- Create more and better unit tests
- Think about the 3 lists in the MessageHandler

- Try to get rid of all the null stuff, use a nullObject

- Look at the way Widgets are used. Or not used...

- Remove the "getDefaultValue" thingy from the AST types? Seems a bit weird. Think about it!
- Check all the variable names!
- Move classes and packages to create a good structure

SHOULD
- Memento for resetting the stateTable?
- Acknowledge also 2 as money instead of only 2.00?
- Factory for the GUI

COULD
- QLS?
