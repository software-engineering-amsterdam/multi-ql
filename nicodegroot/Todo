MUST
- Remove the tempvariable smell! Just pass it on?
- Check all the variable names!
- Create GUI
- Create tests
- Throw errors instead of adding them to a list

SHOULD
- Add line numbers
- Make some kind of fancy issue class
- Use multiple generic types for the visitor interface, or multiple interfaces

COULD
- Really use accept in the QuestionVisitor to fetch the identfiers, otherwise you get 10 gets behind each other. 
	And it makes the visitor kinda lame.
