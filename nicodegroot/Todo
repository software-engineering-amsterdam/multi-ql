MUST
- Fix the different visitor interfaces, so I don't have to include them all for every concreteVisitor
- Remove the tempvariable smell! Just pass it on?
- Check all the variable names!
- Create GUI
- Create more tests
- Throw errors instead of adding them to a list

SHOULD
- Fix line numbers in error messages
- Make some kind of fancy issue class

COULD
- Really use accept in the QuestionVisitor to fetch the identfiers, otherwise you get 10 gets behind each other. 
	And it makes the visitor kinda lame.
