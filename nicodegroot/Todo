MUST
- Remove the tempvariable smell! Just pass it on?
- Check all the variable names!
- Check if all the equal methods require instanceof. (Test this by doing a equal on two different types)
- Create more and better unit tests
- Think about the 3 lists in the MessageHandler
- Move classes and packages to create a good structure
- Remove all the null stuff
- Remove the "getDefaultValue" thingy from the AST types? Seems a bit weird.

SHOULD
- Acknowledge also 2 as money instead of only 2.00?
- Dependency based evaluating may be very cool, so the fixpoint loop is not needed anymore.
- Memento for resetting the stateTable?
- Factory for the GUI

COULD
- QLS?
